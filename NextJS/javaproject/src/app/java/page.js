              Java is an open-source, class-based, high-level, and object-oriented programming language. It is
              platform-independent because Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system with a
              Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

                <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Creation:</span> Java was created by James Gosling in
                1995.
                <br />
                <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Original Purpose:</span> Initially, it was designed for
                the television industry.
                <br />
                <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Green Team:</span> Gosling worked with a team known as
                the Green Team, and their project was called Greentalk.
                <br />
                <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Name Change:</span> The project was later renamed OAK,
                after the oak tree outside Gosling's office. However, due to trademark issues with Oak Technologies, the
                name was changed to Java.
